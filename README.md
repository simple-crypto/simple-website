The Secure Cryptographic Implementation Association (short SIMPLE-Crypto Association) is a non-profit organization created in order 
to develop open source cryptographic implementations and to maintain them over time, with an initial focus on strong 
embedded security guarantees (e.g., resistance against side-channel attacks, fault attacks and other physical 
security issues), extendable to other optimization goals. Projects include software developments 
and hardware developments, for various cryptographic  functionalities.
