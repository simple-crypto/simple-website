The Secure Cryptographic Implementation Association (short SIMPLE-crypto) is a non-profit organization created in order 
to develop open source cryptographic implementations and to maintain them over time, with a focus on strong 
embedded security guarantees (e.g., resistance against side-channel attacks, fault attacks and other physical 
security issues). Projects include software developments and hardware developments, for various cryptographic 
functionalities.
