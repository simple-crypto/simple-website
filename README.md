The Secure Cryptographic Implementation Association (short SIMPLE-Crypto Association) is a non-profit organization created in order 
to develop open source cryptographic implementations and to maintain them over time. It targets various
optimization goals, including but not limited to strong embedded security guarantees (e.g., resistance against side-channel attacks, fault attacks 
and other physical security issues). Projects include software developments and hardware developments, for various cryptographic functionalities.
