The Secure Cryptographic Implementation Association (short SIMPLE-Crypto Association) is a non-profit organization created in order 
to develop open source cryptographic implementations and to maintain them over time. It targets various
optimization goals, including but not limited to strong embedded security guarantees (e.g., resistance against 
side-channel attacks, fault attacks and other physical security issues). Projects include software 
developments and hardware developments, for various cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
