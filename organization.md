# Organization 

The SIMPLE-Crypto Association is based on a flexible model with minimum 
overheads. It is aimed to enable the integration and maintenance of code projects from 
different partners. At high level, we
start funding researchers (possibly co-affiliated with 
other research institutes or universities) to evaluate and maintain the
codes once our scientific council expressed sufficient interest and we
collected sufficient sponsoring. Details about the yearly schedule of the association,
the lifetime of its projects and its licening policy are given next.

** Yearly schedule of the association**

A typical year of the SIMPLE-Crypto Association follows four main steps:

* <strong><em>Step 1.</em></strong> The developers of the association write a public 
report describing yearly progresses and listing potential plans for the next year.   
* <strong><em>Step 2.</em></strong> Sponsors meet during a yearly workshop to discuss 
the report and identify promising developments. The report is updated based on this feedback.
* <strong><em>Step 3.</em></strong> The scientific council reviews the proposed developments
and establishes a priority list with potential developers. The report is updated based on this feedack.
* <strong><em>Step 4.</em></strong> Developers are contacted following the priority list and
projects are launched for one year.


**Lifetime of the association's projects**

The typical lifetime of an open source project follows the following steps:

* <strong><em>Target identification</em></strong>. The association researchers 
will follow relevant research advances and write a yearly report summarizing progresses
and potential next developments. A yearly sponsors' workshop will take place
to collect feedback and additional suggestions of future developments, based on which the report will be 
updated. The report will finally be transmitted to a scientific council which
will again provide feedback and lead to an update of the report. 
The association board will decide on the yearly developments based on this process.

* <strong><em>Development</em></strong>. The selected projects will be 
developed towards prototype codes with accurate documentation, and their
(e.g., physical) security will be evaluated internally, by the association's
researchers.

* <strong><em>Public evaluation</em></strong>. Once reaching a sufficient level of maturity, the code projects will be 
submitted to public evaluation. Concretely, it means that the open source 
code will be made available together with data sets enabling the verification
(and possible improvement) of our security evaluations.

* <strong><em>Release and maintenance</em></strong>. Once the security levels suggested
by the internal and external analyses of a code project seem to "saturate over time", the code will be tagged as released.
The association researchers will go on maintaining the code and collecting
improved analyses as long as the code is considered relevant by the sponsors, scientific council and board.

**Licencing policy of the association** 

* <strong><em>Contributor license agreement</em></strong>. We generally request a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no charge, royalty-free and irrevocablelicense to contributors.

* <strong><em>Dual licensing approach</em></strong>. Unless exception, the codes developed by the association
will be made available under an open source GPL-like license. In order to allow sponsors
to integrate these codes in products without the GPL constraints, we propose a dual licensing model
providing the benefits of a non-copyleft license to our gold sponsors.
