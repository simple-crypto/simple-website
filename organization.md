# Organization 

The SIMPLE-Crypto Association is based on a flexible model with minimum 
overheads. It is aimed to enable the integration and maintenance of code projects from different partners. At high level,
we request a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no charge, royalty-free and irrevocable
license to contributors and start funding researchers (possibly co-affiliated with 
other research institutes or universities) to evaluate and maintain the
codes once our scientific council expressed sufficient interest and we
collected sufficient sponsoring.

**Projects' selection and steps**

The typical lifetime of an open source project follows the following steps:

* <strong><em>Target identification</em></strong>.
* <strong><em>Development</em></strong>.
* <strong><em>Public evaluation</em></strong>.
* <strong><em>Release and maintenance</em></strong>.
