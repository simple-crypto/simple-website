title: PQM4 masked
---

Side-channel protected implementations (masking) of post-quantum algorithms for
embedded platforms.
We aim at proposing implementations of standardized algorithms, most
importantly ML-KEM and ML-DSA.


Scientific publications introduce [the masking approach and the Kyber implementation](https://doi.org/10.46586/tches.v2022.i4.553-588) and
a [Dilithium implementation](https://doi.org/10.46586/tches.v2023.i4.58-79).

Current status:
- [Lifetime stage](/about/organization#lifetime): Development (in progress - Kyber768 done).
