title: SCALE
---

SCALE (standing for Side-Channel Analysis and Leakage Explorations) is
SIMPLE-Crypto’s training on side-channel analysis and leakage-resistance.  It
aims to help designers integrating our open source solutions in their products
and more generally to provide the theoretical and practical background needed
to design implementations with strong embedded security guarantees.

The training will be in three parts:

* **SCALE-I** is on side-channel analysis basics (evaluation tools and theoretical background).
* **SCALE-II** is on leakage-resistance (security definitions, model-level countermeasures and primitive-level countermeasures).
* **SCALE-III** is on secure implementations (in software and hardware).

**SCALE-I details:**

* Next date: **June 10 - June 12, 2024**
* Venue: Martin’s Louvain-le-Neuve (rue de l'Hocaille 1, 1348 Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve)
