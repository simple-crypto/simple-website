**SCALib** is SIMPLE-Crypto's Side-Channel evaluation library.
It is a Python package that contains state-of-the-art tools for side-channel security evaluations. 
It focuses on providing efficient implementations of analysis methods widely used by the 
side-channel research community and maintaining a simple and flexible interface.

The library is used as a first tool to assess the security of our open source implementations.
It is also used in multiple side-channel research teams across the world.

Current status:
- Multiple evaluation algorithms implemented.
- Excellent performance in [benchmarks](https://github.com/cassiersg/SCABench) compared other open-source libraries.
- Continuously improved, expanded and released on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scalib).
