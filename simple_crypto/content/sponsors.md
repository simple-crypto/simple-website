The SIMPLE-Crypto Association is funded by donations from world-class security organisations committed to our missions.
Our standard (yearly) sponsorship levels are described next. <!-- together with a list of public sponsors.  -->

# Sponsorships

* **SUPPORTER level (free)**. This level is aimed to support 
the high-level vision of the association. It gives access to the annual sponsors' workshop
which is the main channel to suggest implementations to develop.

* **BRONZE level (5,000 €)**. This level provides the benefits of a supporter-level 
sponsorship, to two tickets to one of the annual trainings organized by the association, and gives 
access the association’s general assembly (as non-voting member).

<!-- * **SILVER-level (10,000 €)**. This level provides the benefits of a bronze-level
sponsorship and to a non-copyleft license for the association's evaluation tools during the membership year
(and to perpetual license for the same code project in the unlikely event that SIMPLE-Crypto ceases operations).  -->

* **GOLD-level (25,000 €)**. This level provides the benefits of a 
bronze sponsorship and to a non-copyleft license for one code project of the association during the membership year
(and to perpetual license for the same code project in the unlikely event that SIMPLE-Crypto ceases operations). 

    Gold sponsoring for multiple code projects leads to adapted fees (20 k€ for
    the 2nd project, 15k€ for the 3rd one, 10k€ for the 4th one and 5k€ for all
    the following ones). 

* **PLATINIUM-level**. This level is for sponsors interested in the development
of a new code project in collaboration with SIMPLE-Crypto. Contact us to
discuss your projects an collaboration opportunities.

Monetary sponsoring can be (in parts) replaced by other contributions (e.g., in-kind). Those
cases are discussed by the association board.
