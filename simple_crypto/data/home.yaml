      We develop **open-source implementations of cryptographic algorithms**
      - specialized for embedded systems (hardware and software),
      - with strong physical security guarantees (e.g., against side-channel and fault attacks),
      - featuring state-of-the art security and performance,
      - maintained in the long-term.

    #      text: "The UCLouvain Crypto Group is opening two short-term positions (3 to 6 months) to start new SIMPLE-Crypto projects: developing a masked hardware implementation of the Ascon AEAD and developing a software masking of Dilithium for micro-controllers (with possibly other countermeasures). The goal of the project is to research and develop high-quality and well-documented open-source implementations, along with preliminary side-channel security evaluations. The work will take place in the dynamic research environment of the Crypto Group at UCLouvain (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) and the SIMPLE-Crypto team, in collaboration with other Ph.D. students, post-doctoral researchers and professors. The candidates should have experience in physical side-channel security and have strong implementation skills (hardware or micro-controller programming, depending on the chosen project). Remote work is possible. "
