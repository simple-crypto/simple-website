# Sponsors

The SIMPLE-Crypto Association is funded by donations from world-class security organisations committed to our missions.
Our standard (yearly) sponsorship levels are described next together with a list of public sponsors. 

**Sponsorships**

* <strong><em>BRONZE Sponsors (5kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship is aimed to support 
the high-level vision of the association. It gives access to the annual sponsors' workshop
which is the main channel to suggest implementations to develop, and access the associationâ€™s general assembly 
(as non-voting member).

* <strong><em>SILVER Sponsors (10kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a bronze 
sponsor, to two tickets to one of the annual trainings organized by the association
and to a non-copyleft license for the association's evaluation tools during the membership year
(and to perpetual license for the same code project in the unlikely event that SIMPLE-Crypto ceases operations). 

* <strong><em>GOLD Sponsors (25kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a 
silver sponsor and to a non-copyleft license for one code project of the association during the membership year
(and to perpetual license for the same code 
project in the unlikely event that SIMPLE-Crypto ceases operations). 

Gold sponsoring for multiple code projects leads to adapted fees (20 kE for the 2nd project,
15kE for the 3rd one, 10kE for the 4th one and 5kE for all the following ones). 

Access to (non-exclusive) proprietary licenses can be considered without direct sponsoring, 
for example in case of  in-kind contributions to the association.
