# Sponsors

The SIMPLE-Crypto Association is funded by donations from world-class security organisations committed to our missions.
Our standard sponsorship levels are described next together with a list of public sponsors. 
Access to (non-exclusive) proprietary licenses can be  considered without direct sponsoring, for example in case of 
in-kind contributions to the association. In such cases, a specific license agreement is decided by the association’s board.

**Sponsorships**

* <strong><em>BRONZE Sponsors (5kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship is aimed to support 
the high-level vision of the association. It gives priority invitation to the annual 
training organized by the association and to the association’s general assembly 
(as non-voting member).

* <strong><em>SILVER Sponsors (10kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a bronze 
sponsor, and to two tickets to the annual training organized by the association.

* <strong><em>GOLD Sponsors (50kE, 25kE for SMEs)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a 
silver sponsor, to a non-GPL license for one code project and to perpetual license for the same code 
project in the unlikely event that SIMPLE-Crypto ceases operations. In case non-copyleft licenses
for _N_ code projects are required, the sponsorship is multiplied by _(N+1)/2N_.

* <strong><em>PLATINIUM Sponsors (>GOLD)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits
of a gold sponsor and is aimed to enable special support to the association's goals.
