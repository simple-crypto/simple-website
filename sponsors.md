# Sponsors

The SIMPLE-Crypto Association is funded by donations from world-class security organisations committed to our missions.
Our standard (yearly) sponsorship levels are described next together with a list of public sponsors. 

**Sponsorships**

* <strong><em>BRONZE Sponsors (5kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship is aimed to support 
the high-level vision of the association. It gives a direct channel to suggest
implementations to develop, priority invitation to the annual 
trainings organized by the association and access the association’s general assembly 
(as non-voting member).

* <strong><em>SILVER Sponsors (10kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a bronze 
sponsor, and to two tickets to one of the annual trainings organized by the association.

* <strong><em>GOLD Sponsors (50kE per project, 25kE for SMEs)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a 
silver sponsor and to a non-copyleft license for one code project during the membership year
(and to perpetual license for the same code 
project in the unlikely event that SIMPLE-Crypto ceases operations). 

Access to (non-exclusive) proprietary licenses can be considered without direct sponsoring, for example in case of 
in-kind contributions to the association. 
Special sponsorships can also be discussed in case non-copyleft licenses for multiple projects are required.
In such cases, a specific license agreement is decided by the association’s board.
