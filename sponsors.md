# Sponsors

The SIMPLE-Crypto Association is funded by donations from world-class security organisations committed to our missions.
Our standard (yearly) sponsorship levels are described next together with a list of public sponsors. 

**Sponsorships**

* <strong><em>BRONZE Sponsors (5kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship is aimed to support 
the high-level vision of the association. It gives access to the annual sponsors' workshop
which is the main channel to suggest implementations to develop, and access the associationâ€™s general assembly 
(as non-voting member).

* <strong><em>SILVER Sponsors (10kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a bronze 
sponsor, and to two tickets to one of the annual trainings organized by the association.

* <strong><em>GOLD Sponsors (25kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a 
silver sponsor and to a non-copyleft license for one code project of the association during the membership year
(and to perpetual license for the same code 
project in the unlikely event that SIMPLE-Crypto ceases operations). 

* <strong><em>PLATINIUM Sponsors (50kE)</em></strong>. This sponsorship provides the benefits of a 
silver sponsor and to a non-copyleft license for all the code projects of the association during the membership year
(and to perpetual license for the same code projects in the unlikely event that SIMPLE-Crypto ceases operations). 

Access to (non-exclusive) proprietary licenses can be considered without direct sponsoring, for example in case of 
in-kind contributions to the association.
