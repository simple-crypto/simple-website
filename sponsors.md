# Sponsors

The SIMPLE Foundation is funded by donations from world-class security organisations committed to our missions.
Our standard sponsorship levels are described next together with a list of public sponsors. 
Access to (non-exclusive) proprietary licenses can be  considered without direct sponsoring, for example in case of 
in-kind contributions to the association. In such cases, a specific license agreement is decided by the associationâ€™s board.
