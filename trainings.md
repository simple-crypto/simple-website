# Trainings

The SIMPLE-Crypto Association organizes both general and specialized trainings in order to help
designers integrating our open source solutions in their products.

**Side-channel analysis and leakage-resistance.** This yearly training
covers the foundations of side-channel analysis, countermeasures and leakage-resilience.
Its focus is on understanding the general principles behind the attacks
and solutions to prevent them. The training is combined with hands on sessions 
based on toy implementations of standard algorithms.

**Using SCALib to evaluate the SIMPLE-Crypto implementations** This more specialized 
training is aimed at designers willing to integrate side-channel resistant
SIMPLE-Crypto implementations in their products. Since such integration may modify the leakage behavior
of our stand-alone codes, the training aims at helping designres re-assessing the implementation
after integration.
