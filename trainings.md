# Trainings


**Side-channel analysis and secure design**
(Starting in 2022). We organize a yearly training covering the foundations of
side-channel analysis, countermeasures and leakage-resilience,
with hands on focused on using the SCALib tools in order to test
the security of open source implementations and help their integration.
