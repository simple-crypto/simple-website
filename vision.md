# Transparency as a measure of maturity

**The case of cryptographic algorithms**

One of the founding bases of modern cryptography is Kerckhoff’s principles: 
a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, 
is public knowledge. This concept can be opposed to so-called “security by obscurity”, 
which rather relies on the secrecy of both the algorithms and implementations used
in a security system.

In the case of cryptographic algorithms, research progresses demonstrated that 
open designs can lead to secure solutions based on sound mathematical principles. 
As illustrated in the following figure for the case of symmetric encryption, 
this possibility to rely on open designs has been driven by three main ingredients.
